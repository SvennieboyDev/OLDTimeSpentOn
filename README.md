Welcome to the OLD Time Spent On file. This file was used for my project, making an app that tracks your time in whatever subject you choose. 
This repository sadly ended, since the project needed way to much of a change, that it was just better starting over in a different file, Time Spent On.
The reason that it had to change was because, even though the logic was in place, the UI looked horrible.
I used kivy, but found out about kivymd, which makes ur apps and UI look so much better.
To change from kivy to kivymd, would be so much work and probably a ton of trial and error.
Also I had some problems with Github Desktop and the repositories, since they wouldn't accept not empty repositories.
And I had previously deleted the TimeSpentOn repository to change it to OLDTimeSpentOn.
So I decided to start in a new, fresh file to keep things organised.

Thanks for reading and thanks for visiting my repository, for further information about my app please refer to the Time Spent On repository.
